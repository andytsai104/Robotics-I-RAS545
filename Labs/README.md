# Vision-Based Path Planning with MyCobot Pro 600 (ROS 2)

This repository contains all ROS 2 packages and reports for a series of labs culminating in a complete
image-based path planning system for the **MyCobot Pro 600** robot.  
The pipeline progresses from basic kinematics to autonomous maze solving.

## ROS 2 Workspace
The `src/` directory includes all packages used across the labs.  
Each lab builds upon the previous one â€” the final package (`maze_solver`) integrates all prior modules.

To build:
```bash
cd ~/mycobot_path_planning_ws
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch maze_solver maze_solver.launch.py
```
