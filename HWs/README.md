## Homework 5 â€“ PID Control Design
- Defined the **plant transfer function**.  
- Analyzed the **open-loop** response to $r(t)=5\sin(2t)$.  
- Designed a **PID controller** and compared control strategies:  
  - **P ($K_p=1$):** Fast but large steady-state error.  
  - **PI ($K_p=0.5, K_i=3$):** Reduced error, unstable due to windup.  
  - **PID ($K_p=0.5, K_i=5, K_d=15$):** Best tracking and stability.  
- Included comparison plots showing improved tracking performance.
